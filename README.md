# ✋🔤 SignToText

This project is a fun experiment that translates hand signs into text using pure math and geometry—no AI or machine learning involved! It leverages Google pipelining for hand landmark detection, but all the logic for interpreting signs is handcrafted and based on mathematical rules. 🤓✨

## 🚀 Features
• **Completely Free**: No paid APIs or subscriptions required. 🆓
• **No AI/ML**: All sign recognition is done with deterministic, math-based logic. No neural networks, no black boxes. 🧮
• **Runs in the Browser**: No server-side processing, everything happens locally. 🌐
• **Google Pipelining**: Uses Google's hand landmark detection pipeline to get hand positions, but all interpretation is custom. ✋

## ⚠️ Limitations
• **Right-Handed Bias**: Some gestures may not work well for left-handed users. 🤚
• **Letter Mix-Ups**: The logic may occasionally confuse similar signs or mix up letters. That's part of the fun! 🔄
• **Experimental**: This is a playful project, not a production tool. Expect quirks and surprises. 🧪


## 📝 Disclaimer
This was a fun project built for learning and experimentation. 0% AI was used in the sign interpretation logic—except for the help of certain comments and bug fixes (thanks, Copilot!). 🤖💬


Enjoy exploring, tinkering, and maybe even improving it! 🎉

Prompt(s):
>Help create a read me mark down, saying this was a fun experiment that uses google pipelining, completely free, uses no AI and ML and pure math, some logic might not work for left hands, and the logic might mix letters up but its what you get for it ect... It was a fun project, 0% ai was used except for help of certain comments and bug fixes. ect make it for github

> add some nice emojis/icons, dont use the long ai dashes "-"
